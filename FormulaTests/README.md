# Comments to Evaluators:

When building the project, it threw an error when using three slashes for the Header XML comment for the file.
I used 2 so it would compile, so hopefully that doesn't dock me points. :)

# Assignment Specific Topics
This Constructor stores certain containers or data to help it hopefully function faster in the future. It stores
	1. An ordered list of all tokens (This should hopefully help when trying to evaluate the function)
	2. A Canonical Represention of the Formula as a String
	3. A HashSet of all Unique variables used. (This should help with dependency graph.)

# Evaluate Tests
These are meant to test all new functionality in our Formula Class, such as:

	1) Evaluate
	2) Equals
	3) ==
	4) !=
	5) GetHashCode
