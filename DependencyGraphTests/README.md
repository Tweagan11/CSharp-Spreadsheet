# Comments to Evaluators:

I developed tests beforehand but didn't fully understand what the implementation looked like, so I altered them to keep the same concept but actually fit the code correctly.

# Assignment Specific Topics
This set of Tests checks the functionality and effenciency of our DependencyGraph class.

A Dependee is defined as follows: If s is a string, the set of all strings t such that (t,s) is in DG is called dependee(s). (The set of things that s depends on.)

A Dependent is definde as follows: If s is a string, the set of all strings t such that (s,t) is in DG is called dependent(s). (The set of things that depend on s.)
